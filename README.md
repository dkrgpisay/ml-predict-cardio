# Exploring Possible Predictors of Heart Diseases (Part 2)

This is an exercise in our Machine Learning class to build ML models using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.

We built on an [existing project by our classmates](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EFBi0tF_dNFBlei0ja_o5GadSXYeB5k5?usp=sharing&fbclid=IwAR1q6IbGmFw1BhQnuuJwUWvl7FAuYMw-VvMtSa7vWfSiGfvPhsGnsQNj2QU) which used a KNN Classifier to determine the presence of heart diseases. We used the same dataset for this iteration.

It was interesting to see how the two other models would perform compared to KNN. We also applied our other new learnings since the first iteration to improve our model.
